            <p>Everyone wants to beat the market. This is what you need to know: almost everyone loses against the market because the market is incredibly good at what it does, not because investors are stupid failures who don't know what they are doing, which may or may not be true.</br></p>
            There are dynamics of markets that are unique - and all favour the deeper and more liquid markets. These are important to know.</br><p></br>
            This site is a resource for investors and traders. All ideas are screened. The very existence of this site is proof that I believe we can achieve stellar returns. But before you charge into this pit of bulls and bears clubbing each other on the head with sticks you need to know what you're up against.
